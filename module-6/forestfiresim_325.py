Description:
    A terminal-based simulation of wildfires spreading through a forest.
    Trees (A) grow randomly, catch fire (@) by chance or from neighbors,
    and burn out leaving empty space.  A permanent lake (~) is placed near
    the center of the display in blue; water cannot burn or be overwritten
    and acts as a natural firebreak that flames cannot cross.
    Requires the third-party 'bext' module for colored terminal output.
Changes from original forestfiresim.py:
    1. Added WATER = '~' constant to represent water/lake cells.
    2. Added lake creation in createNewForest(): a rectangular block of
       WATER cells is placed roughly in the center of the grid.
    3. Added water-preservation rule in the main loop: WATER cells are
       always copied unchanged to nextForest, making them permanent.
    4. Fire spread logic only ignites TREE neighbors, so water cells are
       naturally immune and act as a firebreak.
    5. Added blue color output for WATER cells in displayForest().
